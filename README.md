# ACT-CMS Website

The Molecular Sciences Software Institute (MolSSI) is pleased to announce the launch of a new education and faculty development program: Accelerating Curricular Transformation in the Computational Molecular Sciences (ACT-CMS). The goal of ACT-CMS is to transform science curricula by accelerating the integration of programming and computation into existing molecular science courses through faculty training and the development of open and reusable curricular modules.

ACT-CMS will achieve this goal by providing faculty with the training and resources needed to integrate programming and computation into their existing courses. ACT-CMS is generously funded by the the National Science Foundation Training-based Workforce Development for Advanced Cyberinfrastructure program (OAC 2321044,OAC 2321045).

## Website Details
The ACT-CMS website is built using [React](https://reactjs.org/).
To run the website locally for development purposes, you can use the provided Docker Composer file.

```bash
docker-compose up

The site is deployed as a static site on GitHub Pages.
