### Dr. Jing Chen

*Software Scientist*   
**The Molecular Sciences Software Institute**  

Dr. Jing Chen is a Software Scientist at the Molecular Sciences Software Institute (MolSSI). She holds a Ph.D. in Fiber and Polymer Science from North Carolina State University and later completed an M.S. in Computer Science at the University of Texas at Dallas, bringing together domain expertise in molecular simulations with formal training in software engineering.

At MolSSI, Dr. Chen specializes in the design and development of scientific software, with a particular focus on web-based research infrastructure. She recently assumed leadership of the [Descriptor Libraries](https://descriptor-libraries.molssi.org/) Project at MolSSI in collaboration with the [Center for Computer-Assisted Synthesis](https://ccas.nd.edu/), aimed at enhancing access to molecular libraries for synthetic chemists. She is also actively working on [QCArchive](https://docs.qcarchive.molssi.org), where she is developing a web application frontend to enable more intuitive and accessible interaction with large-scale quantum chemistry datasets. 

In addition, Dr. Chen designed and developed the [MolSSI public website](https://molssi.org) and has contributed to several community-driven projects, including the molecular dynamics analysis package MDTraj. Her work focuses on lowering technical barriers to advanced molecular modeling tools and promoting sustainable, reusable software practices across the computational molecular sciences.
