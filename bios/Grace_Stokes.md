### Prof. Grace Stokes

*Associate Professor*  
**Santa Clara University**  

Prof. Grace Stokes works at Santa Clara University, a primarily undergraduate institution located in Silicon Valley. 
Her research focuses on using nonlinear optical spectroscopies (second harmonic and sum frequency generation) to study drug–lipid interactions. 
Prof. Stokes is a Cottrell Scholar, Dreyfus Teacher-Scholar and recipient of NSF CAREER award. 
Although she is not formally trained in computational chemistry or computer programming, 
Dr. Stokes has integrated Python-based activities into the upper-division physical chemistry and lower-division general chemistry courses that she teaches. 
These Python-based tools help students better visualize mathematical relationships and build algorithmic thinking skills. 
She is the co-founder of the “Enhancing Science Courses by Integrating Python” (ESCIP) group. 
ESCIP aims to train faculty to more effectively incorporate Python coding into STEM courses, collaboratively develop innovative teaching resources, and provide a web-based repository for sharing Jupyter Notebooks and other educational materials.
